**Purpose**: Validate integration requirements and compatibility with existing language features for the data structures implementation
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are requirements for using arrays in control flow statements (loops, conditionals) specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK002 Are requirements for using structs in function parameters and return values specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [x] CHK003 Are integration requirements with existing variable types and operations documented? [Completeness, Key Entities]
- [x] CHK004 Are requirements for array/struct integration with output operations defined? [Completeness, User Stories]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK005 Is the integration with control flow syntax clearly defined without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK006 Are rules for passing arrays/structs to functions explicitly stated? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]
- [x] CHK007 Is struct integration with existing type system unambiguous? [Clarity, Key Entities]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK008 Are integration requirements consistent with existing language feature patterns? [Consistency, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK009 Do array and struct integration rules align with each other? [Consistency, Spec §FR-001, FR-004]
- [x] CHK010 Are integration behaviors consistent across different contexts (functions, loops, output)? [Consistency, User Stories]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK011 Are requirements defined for all integration scenarios (arrays in loops, structs in functions)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-010, FR-011]
- [x] CHK012 Are nested integration scenarios addressed (arrays of structs, structs with array fields)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK013 Are integration requirements covered for all existing language constructs? [Coverage, Spec §FR-010, FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are integration edge cases defined (passing large arrays to functions, complex struct nesting)? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [x] CHK015 Are error handling requirements specified for integration failures? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-009]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK016 Are performance requirements for integrated operations specified? [Non-Functional, Technical Context]
- [x] CHK017 Are memory/safety requirements maintained during integration? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-008]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK018 Are dependencies on existing language features documented? [Dependencies, Spec §FR-010]
- [x] CHK019 Are assumptions about integration compatibility validated? [Assumptions, Key Entities]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK020 Are there ambiguous integration points that need clarification? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-011]
- [x] CHK021 Do integration requirements conflict with existing feature behaviors? [Conflict, Spec §FR-010]
